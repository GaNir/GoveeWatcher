# Govee Watcher
Proof of concept Bluetooth broadcast decoder from Govee H5075 Thermometer Hygrometer

Versions:
* [NodeJS](./odeJS)
* [Python 3](./python)

## How does it work
The Govee H5075 Thermometer Hygrometer broadcasts the current temperature and humidity through Bluetooth low energy (BLE) advertisement data.

### Packets

From the socket data provided by [python-bleason](https://github.com/TheCellule/python-bleson) debug logging and [advlib's decoding information](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib)

#### Base
| Octets | Value if static | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-7 |  | Header?
| 8-13 |  `ZZ YY XX 38 c1 a4` | [MAC Address in reverse order.  Example a4:c1:38:XX:YY:ZZ](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib#address)
| 14 | `1f` | ?
| 15 | `0d`| [Length of local name](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib#local-name)
| 16| `09` | [Complete Local Name](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib#local-name)
| 17-24 | `47 56 48 35 30 37 35 5f` | First part of device name "GVH5075_"
| 25 -28 |  | Last four hex values (last two octets) of the MAC address spell out in ASCII.

#### Example of temperature/humidity advertisement
| Octets | Value if static | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 29 | `03` | Length of payload |
| 30 | `03` | flag for "Complete List of 16-bit UUIDs"
| 31 -32 | `88 ec` | Manufacturer Key
| 33 -35 | `02 01 05` | GAP list of 32-bit UUIDs but it is empty(?)
| 36 | | Length of payload.  For this instance it is `09`
| 37 | `ff` | Manufacture data flag
| 38 -39 | `88 ec` | Manufacturer Key
| 41 | `00` | padding?
| 42 - 44 |  | Encoded temperature and humidity
| 45 | `00` | padding ?

### Decoding Data
The three octets are concatenated together and parsed into an integer
Example:
`03 21 5d` -> `03215d` --parse integer--> `205149`

Once we have this integer, for the temperature in Celsius , divide by 10000
```
205149 / 10000 = 20.5149Â°C
```

Humidity is modulus 1000 divided by 10
```
205149 % 1000 = 149
149 / 10 = 14.9% humidity
```

### Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
There is a second advertisement signal contains the ManufacturerData Key `0x004c` and payload data `INTELLI_ROCKS`, (Govee is the brand name, the manufacture is "Shenzhen Intellirocks Tech. Co., Ltd.").  Based on the finding in [neilsheps/GoveeTemperatureAndHumidity](https://github.com/neilsheps/GoveeTemperatureAndHumidity), this relevant to the Apple iOS application.  This however provides the RSSI for the device.

### Historical data?
This is only a proof of concept for decoding BLE advertisements and do not plan on continuing on to load historical data.  Thes are done through commands sent to GATT services.

## TODO:
  * determine battery percentage
  * determine how/if negative temperatures are transmitted
